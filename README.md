# convertLogs

This application has the same functionality as Blackboard's [convertLogs.py](https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Administrator/SaaS/System_Management/Logs#format-logs-to-be-more-readable_OTP-3) script, but also supports drag/drop of folders or ZIP files onto the application for quick extraction. Download a ZIP package from Saas, drag onto the application, and it does the rest for you.
